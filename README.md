# Geese Patrol
--------------

Note: I will have the website's source code up on github in a few days, I just need to learn PHP to make the website function as needed.

Geese Patrol is a website that contains a bulletin of reports on geese attacks or geese nests, as canadian geese have a large population at the University of Waterloo. Anyone is allowed to report, and the website helps you create a good report for others to know, so that they may plan a route to avoid or be cautious in various parts on campus.

There is a map provided by google maps, embedded by the google maps JavaScript API, that allows users to easily locate where a report was made.

The website was designed by CSS embedded on the HTML page.
