# Geese Patrol
--------------

Update: The site is complete, I now am working on hosting the site. The link + source code should be up soon.

Geese Patrol is a website that contains a bulletin of reports on geese attacks or geese nests, as canadian geese have a large population at the University of Waterloo. Anyone is allowed to report, and the website helps you create a good report for others to know, so that they may plan a route to avoid or be cautious in various parts on campus.

There is a map provided by google maps, embedded by the google maps JavaScript API, that allows users to easily locate where a report was made.

The website was designed by CSS embedded on the HTML page.
